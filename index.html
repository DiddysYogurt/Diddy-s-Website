    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
        In 2010, Robert Hampton, aka “Diddy,”—a name lovingly given by his grandchildren—founded Diddy’s Yogurt Shoppe.
        In 2022, we were blessed with the opportunity to purchase this small-town business nestled in the heart of Longview, TX.
        Although Robert Hampton has since passed away, we strive to pour our love into our customers and community by his great example.
        We want to thank everyone who has supported us along the way, and it is our blessing to serve you.
